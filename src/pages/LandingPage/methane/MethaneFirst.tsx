        <p>
          In the heart of Earth's natural cycles, lay a seemingly innocuous gas
          called methane. It had been present since time immemorial, generated
          by both natural processes and human activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Methane, a byproduct of decay and digestion in the animal kingdom,
          emerged from swamps, wetlands, and the bellies of livestock. Yet, it
          was also born from human endeavorsâ€”agriculture, landfills, and the
          extraction and use of fossil fuels.
